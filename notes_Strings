--- About SQL strings ---

always check the documentation for the database system we used.


--- Finding the length of a string ---
# LENGTH

> SELECT Name, LENGTH(Name) AS Len
> FROM City
> ORDER BY Len DESC, Name;



--- Selecting part of a string
# SUBSTR

The three arguments for the SUBSTR() function in SQLite:
string to evaluate, starting position, length of string

> SUBSTR('this string', 6);
> this one means from position 6 to the end, so will return "string"

> SUBSTR('this string', 6, 3);
> this one will return "str"



--- Removing spaces ---
# TRIM # LTRIM # RTRIM 

> SELECT TRIM('   string   ');
> return "string"

> SELECT TRIM('The test was a treat','t');
> return "The test was a trea"

> SELECT LTRIM('   string   ');
> return "string   "

> SELECT RTRIM('   string   ');
> return "   string"

> SELECT RTRIM('...string...', '.');
> return "...string"



--- Folding case ---
# LOWER # UPPER

> SELECT LOWER(Name) FROM City ORDER BY Name;
> SELECT UPPER(Name) FROM City ORDER BY Name;

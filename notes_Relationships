--- Understanding JOIN ---



--- Accessing related tables ---

> we have two table "left" and "right", and each of these tables have two columns id and description.

> SELECT l.description AS left, r.description AS right
> FROM left AS l
> JOIN right AS r ON l.id = r.id;

> SELECT l.description AS left, r.description AS right
> FROM left AS l
> LEFT JOIN right AS r ON l.id = r.id;



--- Relating multiple tables ---

> we have three table "sale", "item" and "customer", and each of these tables some columns.

> SELECT c.name AS Cust. c.zip, i.name AS Item, i.description, s.quantity AS Quan, s.price AS Price
> FROM sale AS s
> JOIN item AS i ON s.item_id = i.id
> JOIN customer AS c ON s.customer_id = c.id
> ORDER BY Cust, Item;

> SELECT c.name AS Cust. c.zip, i.name AS Item, i.description, s.quantity AS Quan, s.price AS Price
> FROM customer AS c
> LEFT JOIN sale AS s ON s.customer_id = c.id
> LEFT JOIN item AS i ON s.item_id = i.id
> ORDER BY Cust, Item;

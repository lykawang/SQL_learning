--- Creating a subselect ---

Subselects are effectively nested queries.

> SELECT ... FROM (
>   SELECT ... FROM ...
> ) AS some_name;



--- Searching within a result set ---

> SELECT * FROM album
> WHERE id IN (SELECT DISTINCT album_id FROM track WHERE duration <= 90);



--- Creating a view ---

A VIEW is like a stored subselect.
Complex views are created from more than one table or joined queries.

> CREATE VIEW trackView AS
>   SELECT id, album_id, title, track_number, duration/60 AS m, duration%60 AS s 
>   FROM track;

> DROP VIEW IF EXISTS trackView;



--- Creating a joined view ---

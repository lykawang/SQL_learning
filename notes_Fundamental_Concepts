--- Creating a table ---

> CREATE TABLE test (
>   a INTEGER,
>   b TEXT
> );



--- Deleting a table ---

> DROP TABLE test;

> DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test;



--- Inserting rows ---

> INSERT INTO test VALUES (1, 'This', 'Right here!');

> INSER INTO test (b, c) VALUES ('That', 'Over there!');

> INSERT INTO test DEFAULT VALUES;
In this case, the inserted value maybe "NULL NULL NULL".

use the results of a "SELECT" statement to add rows to a table.
> INSERT INTO test (a, b, c) SELECT id, name, description from item;



--- Deleting rows --- 

> DELETE FROM test WHERE a = 3;



--- THE NULL value ---

NULL presents the lack of a value, so the regular equal expression can not use on NULL.

> SELECT * FROM test WHERE a IS NULL:

> SELECT * FROM test WHERE a IS NOT NULL:

> CREATE TABLE test (
>  a INTEGER NOT NULL,
>  b TEXT NOT NULL,
>  c TEXT
> );
> INSERT INTO test (b, c) VALUES ('one', 'two');
In this case, the INSERT INTO statement will get an error since the value for column a cannot be NULL.



--- Constraining columns ---

add an UNIQUE constraint
set a DEFAULT value
> CREATE TABLE test (a TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL, b TEXT, c TEXT DEFAULT 'panda');

Depending on different database system, NULL values may be exempted from the UNIQUE constraint.



--- Changing a schema ---

> ALTER TABLE test ADD d TEXT;
By default, the existing table will add a column d where all the value in column d is NULL.

> ALTER TABLE test ADD e TEXT DEFAULT 'panda';



--- ID columns ---

An ID columns is a culumn that holds a unique value for each row in a table. Typically, they are automatically populated.
How to create an ID columns is different for every database system.

syntax for SQLite databases
> CREATE TABLE test (
>   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
>   a INTEGER,
>   b TEXT
> );
> INSERT INTO test (a, b) VALUES (10, 'a');
In this case, I don't need to insert a value for the id columns. It will be auto-generated from 1 to somewhere.

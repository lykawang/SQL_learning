--- What are aggregates? ---
# GROUP BY

> SELECT Region, COUNT(*) AS Count
> FROM Country
> GROUP BY Region
> HAVING Count >=5
> ORDER BY Count DESC, Region;

WHERE clause should be before the GOURP BY clause,
HAVING clause should be after the GOURP BY clause



--- Using aggregate functions --- 
# COUNT # AVG # MIN # MAX # SUM



--- Aggregating DISTINCT values ---
# DISTINCT

> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT HeadOfState) FROM Country;

In some system like Oracle, the UNIQUE keyword does the same thing

--- What are transactions? ---

> BEGIN TRANSACTION
>   INSERT INTO table_1
>   INSERT INTO table_2
> END TRANSACTION



--- Data integrity ---

> BEGIN TRANSCTION;
> INSERT INTO widgetSales (inv_id, quan, price) VALUES (1, 5, 500);
> UPDATE widgetInventory SET onhand = (onhand-5) WHERE id=1;
> END TRANSCTION

In MySQL, the syntax is START TRANSCTION with COMMIT

If add a ROLLBACK before the END TRANSCTION, all actions between the two transction clause will be ignored.

> BEGIN TRANSCTION;
> INSERT INTO widgetSales (inv_id, quan, price) VALUES (1, 5, 500);
> ROLLBACK;
> END TRANSCTION
In this case, the new values will not be inserted into the widgetSales table.



--- Performance ---
 
 Things happen a lot faster with the transaction.
